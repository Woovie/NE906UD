If this name means anything to you, you likely own a television produced by Funai. I found online documentation for their CRTs to be extremely lacking, so here's my documentation!

# Sources

Most of this information would not be possible if not for [Gopakumar Gopalan](https://www.blogger.com/profile/06254517076570675451) via [their blog post here](https://electronicshelponline.blogspot.com/2013/06/symphonic-funai-rca-ilo-iwt3206-service.html), which lead me to also find a [service manual for a display](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/2346656/Ilo-Iwt3206.html) that uses this same remote.

This allowed me to find that I just needed to modify my remote to find the service menu for my CRT display.

You will notice I've uploaded some PDFs to this repository. I've obtained these from [ManualsLib](https://www.manualslib.com/) and claim no ownership. I am storing them for historical purposes to ensure they are not lost to time.
