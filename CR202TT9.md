# Trutech CR202TT9

## Introduction

I recently became the owner of one of these CRTs for free, so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get back into CRTs. Here I am documenting the various menus to help others who may find themselves owners of these televisions. They were cheap and common, sold as an inhouse Target brand and produced by Funai

## Manual

The manual can be found [here](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/479694/Trutech-Cr202tt9.html). I mostly did not use this manual.

## Factory Menu

Once you have followed [the guide](MODIFYING.md) for modifying the remote to be a factory remote, you can enter the factory settings! I am going to document the various menus I find here and what buttons to press to get to the menu.
