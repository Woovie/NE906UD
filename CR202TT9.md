# Trutech CR202TT9

## Introduction

I recently became the owner of one of these CRTs for free, so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get back into CRTs. Here I am documenting the various menus to help others who may find themselves owners of these televisions. They were cheap and common, sold as an inhouse Target brand and produced by Funai

## Manual

The manual can be found [here](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/479694/Trutech-Cr202tt9.html). I mostly did not use this manual.

## Factory Menus

Once you have followed [the guide](MODIFYING.md) for modifying the remote to be a factory remote, you can enter the factory settings! I am going to document the various menus I find here and what buttons to press to get to the menu.

### Version/Diagnostic Information

Pressing SLEEP, you will see some information on screen. Mine contained the following, although I ultimately have zero idea the purpose of this information.

```
128             128
  A13-0.20. 17
   21
   
   
   00
   6D01.        M
128             128
```

If someone has any idea what this information conveys, please make a pull request ðŸ™‚

Pressing INFO, we see something very similar.

```
FF              128
  A13-0.20. 17
   21
   
   
   00
   6D01.        M
128             128
```

Initially, it is white, blinks for a moment, then turns red. I again have no idea what this conveys.
